## Designed test scenarios for packet loss, distance, and latency

I created test cases to measure packet delivery success under different conditions, such as:

Varying distances between ESP32s.

Environments with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth interference.

High-rate packet bursts. I collected metrics like RSSI (signal strength), packet timestamps, and loss rates to validate the robustness and speed of the communication.

##Communication Flow
Initialization

Initialize ESP-NOW on both devices.

Exchange and add peer MAC addresses.

Sending Data

ESP32-A prepares a packet.

Uses esp_now_send() to send it to ESP32-B.

Receiving Data

ESP32-B triggers onDataRecv().

Packet is decoded and processed.

Acknowledgment (optional)

ESP32-B can send a small ACK packet back if needed.

Error Handling
