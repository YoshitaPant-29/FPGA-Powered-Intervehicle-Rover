#Designed test scenarios for packet loss, distance, and latency

I created test cases to measure packet delivery success under different conditions, such as:

Varying distances between ESP32s.

Environments with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth interference.

High-rate packet bursts. I collected metrics like RSSI (signal strength), packet timestamps, and loss rates to validate the robustness and speed of the communication.
